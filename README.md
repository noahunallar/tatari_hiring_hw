Thanks for giving me the opportunity to work on this homework. I hope this serves as a good indicator to how I think about data and write code to make use of it. 

## Timeboxing

Incomplete or unfinished code does not truly represent my approach to programming. Therefore, I devoted little more than two hours to this assignment. I feel like complete code is more enlightening than anything else:)

## Description

It was written in Python 3 that simply consumes both `rotations.csv`, `spots.csv` and generates output that shows:
  * Cost per View by two dimensions:
      1. CPV by Creative(Business lingo for a TV ad)
      2. CPV by Rotation(The timerange on a TV network that an ad airs in) by day

### Details

Assumptions has been made where necessary and clearly documented in the code. In case you need further clarification, please let me know. 

Thanks again!
